The logo must be recognizable even in miniature. Transparent background mandatory. Design suitable for professional and web use.

Ultra-simplified design recognizable at 32x32 pixel size. The graphic element must be an abstract symbol related to web/code (such as a stylized chevron, bracket, or tech geometric shape). Perfectly square format. Transparent background. Clean lines. Adapted to appear in a browser tab.
```

### 3. Apple Touch Icon (apple-touch-icon.png)
